Python modules and what they are used for:

BeautifulSoup --> for parsing structured Data
requests --> for making requests to Webpages(GET,POST..etc)
Selinium --> it's a slimed down browser version that executes JS.
requests-html --> for rendering JS (as some webpages only sends JS rather than HTML)
